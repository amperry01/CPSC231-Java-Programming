Assignment or exercise number: MP1: Chipotle Ordering System

OVERVIEW
A java program that has 2 classes to represent objects that would be used in a Chipotle ordering system. 
These classes are used in a Driver class which will create a few orders for Burritos.

ERRORS
There are no known compiling or runtime errors. However, I would have liked to add in constraints that
ensured there were no invalid inputs for the Burrito class members. Such as, sizes other than "regular" or "kids"
so that the if else statements in the cost calculation are more accurate if spelling mistakes are made or invalid sizes are used.

SOURCES
No outside sources were used other than class materials and zyBooks.
