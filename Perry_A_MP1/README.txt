Assignment or exercise number: MP1: Mirror Flipping Images 

OVERVIEW
A Java program that takes an image and flips it both vertically and horizontally to simulate
a complete mirror image flip.

CLASSES/METHODS USED

// method to display the image in all orientations
    // method name is displayImage
    // data type returned is void as it just prints out the image
    // the one parameter passed in is the 2D char array that is to be printed
    // private static void displayImage(char[][] image){}

// method to flip image horizontally
    // method name is horizontalMirror
    // data type returned is a 2D char array (horizontally flipped image)
    // the one parameter passed in is a 2D char array (image to be flipped)
    // private static char[][] horizontalMirror(char[][] image){}

// method to flip image vertically
    // method name is verticalMirror
    // data type returned is a 2D char array (vertically flipped image)
    // the one parameter passed in is a 2D char array (image to be flipped)
    // private static char[][] verticalMirror(char[][] image){}

// main method
    // formatting with print statements
    // create a 2D array of chars called image (hard coded, no user input)
    // call displayImage method
    // call horizontalMirror method and display
    // call verticalMirror method and display
    // call displayImage method with resulting horizontally and vertically flipped image


ERRORS
I had a few errors due to forgotten semi colons, spelling, and renaming things 
but not changing every instance of what I renamed. However, I did not yet know I 
needed to write down the errors I had, so I don't have the actual errors I had. 
They were simple errors I was able to fix on my own with no problems.

Will include errors encountered as I work next MP.
