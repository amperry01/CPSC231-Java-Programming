Assignment or exercise number: MP3B: ERS

OVERVIEW
A java program that mimics the gameplay of ERS.

ERRORS
There are no known compiling or runtime errors.
I wanted to include a recursive function which is commented out in the Game.faceOff() method to keep
running face-offs until a non face-card was played but had too many issues trying to figure it out.

SOURCES
I got help from a friend in another CPSC 231 course Kamron Swingle for how to continuously 
iterate through a LinkedList in a circle without going out of bounds.
